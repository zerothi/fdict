# 1. Include the "setup.make" file
#    in case it exists.
#    This is the preferred way a user should

# 2. Include the $(SETUP) file.
#    The user may specify SETUP=<> on the `make`
#    line to (in addition to 1.) include the
#    corresponding setup file.
#    This setup file may also be a shortname for
#    any of the files in the:
#       smeka/setup/*.make
#    folder.

# Detect whether the user requests
# a special setup.make file from the default
# repository.
# If the file is found it will be included.
# If the file is NOT found an error will be issued
# immediately and the Make script will exit.

# Check whether the local "setup.make" file
# exists, if so, include it
